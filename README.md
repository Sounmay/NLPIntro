An an introduction to Natural Language Processing, I have created a model to use the IMDb dataset to input reviews and find mathematical relationships between words, a model to demonstrate word embeddings by using similar words in vectorized representations, and a model to use words from a Shakespeare poetry dataset and create unique poetry by itself. This code is not my own, it was part of a course I took on freeCodeCamp, although I have cleaned the code according to my preferences. 

This is a beginner guide which can be followed by anyone, so please keep contributing.
